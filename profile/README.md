Hello, we are **AnonElitists**, a group of friends who just like to make random projects.

## How it started

We are all university students, studying Computer Engineering. This was a good way to learn stuff while having fun and, most importantly, being dumb together.

## What we are working on at the moment

* 2D Game with Unity
* This organization's website
